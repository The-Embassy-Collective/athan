## About

Athan time is a simple app that displays the prayer times for the day and notifies the user when it is time to pray. It is built using [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/), a framework for building desktop apps using web technologies.

P.S: The application was written with 0 knowledge about Rust or Tauri. Everything was learnt live on stream.

P.S2: [Maadlou](http://maadlou.com/) designed the full UI live as well using Figma & Adobe Illustrator
